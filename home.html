    <p>Tracy Ealey (aka The Crazy Oil Lady) is a local artist and holistic
      entrepreneur.  She has devoted much of her life to helping others.  She
      currently works with children of all ages and backgrounds through her job
      at a residential treatment facility and her weekly kid’s night at a local
      casual dining restaurant that she has been hosting for the last 18 years.
    </p>
    <p>In 2016 Tracy started Soul. Oils and Collectibles.  Her great passion is
      bringing hope and wellness to people through a holistic approach using
      essential oils. When Tracy is not impacting a child’s life or teaching
      others of the benefits of essential oils she can be found creating
      whimsical objects and turning trash to treasure items to give objects
      second lives.
    </p>
    <p>Tracy is currently enrolled in East Tennessee State University where she
      is pursuing a Master’s degree in Social Work.  She graduated from Tusculum
      College with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with a concentration in
      Behavior Health.
